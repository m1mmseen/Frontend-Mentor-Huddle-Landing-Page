## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup

- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I run in an issue with the header and the main section, because of the float of the header image. So i must use the clearfix :)

```css
.clearfix {
  content: "";
  clear: both;
  display: block;
}
```
